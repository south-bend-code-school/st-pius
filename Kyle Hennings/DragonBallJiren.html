Throughout the tournament he basically serves as a barrier for Goku and the others, with even Goku's Mastered Ultra Instinct not being enough to beat him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesHeel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesHeel">Achilles' Heel</a>: After seeing 17 sneaks up behind Jiren and damage his back, Goku realizes that Jiren can be hurt by large attacks if he's caught off guard. The problem is that Jiren is <em>rarely</em> caught off guard.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalBadass">Adaptational Badass</a>: A Downplayed version, since his strength is essentially the same in both versions, but in the manga <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jiren never gets knocked down and nearly eliminated by Mastered Ultra Instinct Goku like he does in the anime. He just straight-up beats him. Nor does the context of the scene try to downplay his victory as happened in the anime (where Jiren expressed shame about having to rely on Goku's stamina running out to beat him); Belmond and his Pride Trooper teammates outright declare him the victor, and no one objects. That said, like the anime, beating MUI Goku still costed him most of his power.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalNiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalNiceGuy">Adaptational Nice Guy</a>:<ul><li> Granted, he is a superhero but from what we have seen so far in the anime is that he is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrogantKungFuGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrogantKungFuGuy">Arrogant Kung-Fu Guy</a> who does not hesitate to show other fighters just how strong he is and doesn't seem to show his care for other people in general like his fellow comrades. In the manga, however, his first appearance has him save the Pride Troopers and the other people from a monster that is currently attacking the planet and holds on a conversation with Toppo as he needs to keep the civilians safe at first. He also initially didn't want to participate in the Tournament of Power because he doesn't want to lead the other universes to erasure and only joins after Belmod promises him the use of the Dragon Balls and to immediately withdraw from the tournament if anything happens in Universe 11. He has also yet to show his <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeCrusher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeCrusher">Hope Crusher</a> habit that leads to his constant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">Kick the Dog</a> moments against 17, Goku, and Vegeta</span>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When Android 17 "sacrifices" himself, he notably laments the outcome ends up declaring that he's not pleased with the outcome and doesn't want to witness such acts, as opposed to telling Goku and Vegeta that they should be grateful his sacrifice saved their "weak selves".</span> Likewise, in <em>Xenoverse 2</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompositeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompositeCharacter">he's actually more like Toppo personality-wise</a>, constantly going on about justice being served (as opposed to being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">The Stoic</a> for the most part in <em>Super</em>).</li><li> However, he does display <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> tendencies. When Kefla starts destroying the Pride Troopers and almost defeats Dyspo and Kahseral, Goku suggests Jiren to "help his allies", but Jiren considers it "unnecessary" and even gives the two a cold glare just as Kefla is about to defeat them. It's only Kefla's sudden shift of focus to Jiren and Goku that ultimately saves the two. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Just like in the anime, when both Toppo and Dyspo are at risk of being knocked out, he does nothing, and allows it, though without reprimanding or insulting his teammates. It should be noted that Toppo and Dyspo were explicitly too weak to do anything at that point in the manga, even jump, so Jiren letting them be eliminated comes off as justified, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint">he's just kinda rude about it</a>.</span></li><li> When Android 17 sacrifices himself, Jiren just tells them that he's <em>quite</em> unhappy that it had to come to that and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllForNothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllForNothing">that, even then, it did nothing</a>. In the anime he rubbed their faces in it, displayed no remorse, and called 17 pathetic.</li><li> In the manga, Jiren doesn't try to murder the audience out of spite while fighting MUI Goku.</li><li> Given that, past his introduction, all the manga does is excise gratuitous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">dog-kicking</a> moments instead of actually changing any plot points, it's very likely that is more of a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalVillainy">Adaptational Villainy</a> on the part of the anime (similar to what was done with Beerus). Generally the plot points in Toriyama's outline are shared between versions, and he's acknowledged that Toei has to add a lot of their own content to turn it into a full-length show (the manga by comparison is much more barebones and closely supervised by Toriyama).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalWimp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalWimp">Adaptational Wimp</a>: His future counterpart portrayal in <em>Xenoverse 2</em> is significantly less impressive, with Jiren getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">brainwashed</a> by Dabura and beaten by the Time Patroller in combat. Making this jarring is that he is canonically the strongest character featured in the Infinite History DLC that isn't Whis or Vados, yet he's treated as simply a lackey to Goku Black and Zamasu. It's possible for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantCatchUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantCatchUp">Krillin, Yamcha, and Tien</a> to beat him, and he isn't even involved with Goku awakening Ultra Instinct either. Unlike other examples, however, this is acknowledged in-game, with Hit stating this alternate version is nothing compared to the real deal.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllForNothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllForNothing">All for Nothing</a>: In the anime. Even if he had won the Tournament of Power and used the Super Dragon Balls for his wish, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his wish would have been considered so selfish that it would leave the Zenos no choice but to destroy Universe 11, meaning he would have doomed his universe alongside the other 7.</span> The manga never gives that condition to begin with, so even had he followed through with his wish instead of changing it at the last second <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">like 17</span>, he'd have been fine. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In a variation however, Belmond reminds Jiren that Gicchin doesn't even want to be revived, which Jiren begrudgingly acknowledges.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllPowerfulBystander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllPowerfulBystander">All-Powerful Bystander</a>: He usually sits on the sidelines until there is an enemy that is powerful enough to require him to step in. His first instance was to stop Kale's rampage and Maji Kayo from taking out Dyspo. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He later does so for Goku and Hit. Once he beats Goku and rings out Hit, he declares he is no longer needed and goes back to meditating.</span> According to the manga, he wasn't even interested in fighting in the Tournament of Power since he didn't like the idea of the destruction of the other universes. He only did because Belmod promised him the use of the Super Dragon Balls.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyJanitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyJanitor">Almighty Janitor</a>: He's just another member of the Pride Troopers when it comes to rank. That said, not only is he stronger than Toppo (the leader of the Pride Troopers, and a contender for a potential God of Destruction), <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he possibly even outclasses the Gods of Destruction in power.

Ordinarily this wouldn't be the case, presumably, but this is a tournament where the Pride Troopers' second-best (Toppo himself) is barely a match for the second-stringers of Universe 7. The anime even makes this a defining factor of the team; the Pride Troopers weren't gathered to fight evil, they all decided to follow Jiren's strength, creating a group that fights evil after joining him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a>: Basically, this is Jiren's specialty.

Jiren seems confident that Goku won't achieve such a form again, and just meditates while letting Toppo and Dyspo take care of the rest. Although Goku at this point would fall easily to Toppo and Dyspo, it's only a matter of time until he achieves his Ultra Instinct form again and challenge Jiren again. To make matters worse, powerhouses like Vegeta, Frieza and Gohan are still fully healthy and could give Dyspo and Toppo plenty of trouble, and sure enough, Frieza and Gohan end up eliminating Dyspo (even if it results in Gohan performing a non-lethal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> that takes him out too) and Vegeta eliminates Toppo.</li><li> When brought to the last fighter of his universe, he largely focuses on taking out Goku and Vegeta, but mostly ignores Android 17 and Frieza.

The dejected Jiren assumed this was because he wasn't strong enough, and so he forsook all attachments to become the strongest mortal in the multiverse. In actuality, the reason Gicchin doubted Jiren was not because of his strength, but because he was concerned that Jiren couldn't work with others or rely on anyone but himself, an essential attribute for a martial artist and superhero; that's why he urged him to join the Pride Troopers. He didn't tell him his intention because he wanted Jiren to learn the lesson himself, but he died before his plan could come to fruition.

Both lost their families at a young age and were left alone until they gained friends and started training under a master, both strive to get stronger and are heroes and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsStrongestMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsStrongestMan">strongest mortals</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">The Aces</a> for their respective universes. In addition, they were both offered the position of their respective universes' next God of Destruction and turned it down due to a lack of interest. There are quite a few differences between them, however:<ul><li> Jiren is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">very serious</a> and fights <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForGreatJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForGreatJustice">For Great Justice</a>, is a full time hero, and only enters the fray when he deems it to be necessary. Goku is an immature thrill-seeker who mainly fights for the thrill of it, helping others and saving the world only if they really need his help, and will at times prioritize his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">desires for a good fight</a> over the safety of others, leading to the endangering of lives. This is particularly emphasized by both of their reactions to being informed of the tournament of power in the manga: Jiren is reluctant to compete, and says that he'll only do so on the condition that he get to freely leave if a crisis in Universe 11 that endangers innocents requires his intervention. Goku is ecstatic about the tournament and doesn't spare a thought to helping anyone. Related to the above, Goku has a bad habit of letting his guard down. Jiren is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerable">untouchable</a> even when he's meditating and is virtually impossible to take by surprise.</li><li> Jiren's friends gathered around him because of his strength, but he considers them impersonal associates, at best; since Jiren is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">disillusioned with the concept of trust and doesn't care about his friends at all</span>. Goku's friends gathered not only because of his strength, but also an odd <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagneticHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagneticHero">personal magnetism</a>, and he truly cares about his friends and treats them like family.</li><li> More specifically, Goku draws <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicWillpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicWillpower">Heroic Willpower</a> from the trust and belief his friends have in him, while Jiren sees personal ties as a liability, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">specifically weaknesses to be shunned, and raw strength as a reliable absolute and acceptable replacement</span>. Jiren has a specific wish in mind for the Super Dragon Balls, while Goku has no idea what to wish for.</li></ul></li><li> He's also one to Hit. Both serve as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">The Ace</a> of their universes, have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">serious demeanors</a>, are similar in size and build, and have reputations for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeyondTheImpossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeyondTheImpossible">achieving the impossible</a>. However Jiren is a hero in his universe, while Hit is an assassin, meaning they have opposite ideologies since Jiren saves lives while Hit takes them. Further contrasts can be seen with their relationship with Goku despite both of them being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">rivals</a> to the Saiyan. Hit came to respect Goku and sees him as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyEnemy">Friendly Enemy</a> who he is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">willing to team up with</a>, while Jiren refuses to see Goku as anything but a menace albeit one who was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a>. Also while Hit proves to be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitmanWithAHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitmanWithAHeart">assassin with a good heart</a> underneath as he is shown to respect and care for his comrades, Jiren is later revealed to be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing">asshole in superhero's clothing</a> who doesn't care for his comrades despite his role as a Pride Trooper.</li><li> Also seems to be one to Frieza. Both had possessed reputations as the strongest beings of their respective universes, both were hyped to be impossibly strong during their respective arcs, both <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">fought against Goku and overpowered both his kaioken state (with an outsider even commenting that Goku was already using the highest level possible) and a spirit bomb, triggering a new, legendary transformation within him</span>, and both can survive in the vacuum of space. The main difference is that Jiren seems to be a paragon of justice, whereas Frieza is reviled as the most evil being in the universe even by the other Gods of Destruction. Additionally, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">while the advent of Super Saiyan was enough to defeat Frieza, the advent of Ultra Instinct was <em>not</em> enough to defeat Jiren</span>. To top it all off, his name, being a pun on the word "stove," is the direct opposite of Frieza's own name pun &#151; "freezer," of course. Whether this is simply a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag">Mythology Gag</a> meant to lend credence to Jiren as a threat or foreshadowing a confrontation between the two remains to be seen.</li><li> After learning his backstory, Jiren has become a foil to Vegeta. Both lost their families to an unstoppable force of pure malice that they've been striving to destroy at any cost. A difference being that Jiren initially believed he could find strength in numbers, while Vegeta was willing to be the last Saiyan standing so long as his race outlived Frieza. Jiren had humble beginnings while Vegeta was born into royalty. Jiren became the revered poster boy for his team, while Vegeta was for a long while a tag-along that the other fighters put up with. Jiren grew to lose respect for his partner Toppo, while Vegeta had a grudging respect for Goku that eventually became a friendly rivalry.</li><li> Jiren's manga counterpart could also be considered one to Zamasu (both anime and manga alike). Both have strong feelings towards justice and they're both the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsStrongestMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsStrongestMan">World's Strongest Man</a> of their respective universes (Zamasu being one to Universe 10, Jiren being one to Universe 11). Jiren's manga counterpart is openly more compassionate than Zamasu and has a strict <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShallNotKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShallNotKill">Thou Shall Not Kill</a> policy. However, Zamasu was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a> (bordering on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TautologicalTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TautologicalTemplar">Tautological Templar</a>) whose "justice" involves the multiversal genocide of gods and mortals alike, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards">claiming mortals to be evil and inferior</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithUsOrAgainstUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithUsOrAgainstUs">but the gods being too stupid to understand his plan</a>. To further elaborate on this, Jiren is disinterested in becoming a deity of any kind, leaving Toppo to be the next candidate for God of Destruction, whereas Zamasu did everything in his power to be the "one, true god". On a smaller level, Jiren is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">cold and calculating</a>, while Zamasu is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsHammy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsHammy">over the top and rash</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut">Freak Out</a>: In the anime. When <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">pushed back by Ultra Instinct Goku, Jiren remembers the trauma of how powerless he was when his friends and master where killed and promptly goes <em>ballistic</em>, actually trying to <em>kill</em> the people in the spectator stands just to disprove Goku's point of how friends make one powerful.</span> In the manga, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">while he does lose his cool, he stays focused on the battle and beats MUI Goku fair and square (partly by the latter running out of energy).

His family? Power can take that away. His master and friends; ooh, power can take that away from him too.

How it stands out from that of other characters is the emphasis of the raw force of his punches.

If Jiren had actually committed his strength to helping his teammates, rather than just waiting around for the other teams to whittle themselves down in order to hoard the wish for himself, there would have been a real chance that his Universe could have won the tourney.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">Honor Before Reason</a>: Not that it matters but Jiren has loads of opportunities to simply eliminate everyone and seal the tournament's fate in his universe's favor, however he is perfectly content to let everyone else handle things until someone powerful enough to reasonably challenge what he's put out at the time stands up to him. In fact, during their first battle he tells Goku that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he would wait patiently for Goku to gather all of the energy for his Spirit Bomb and not attack Goku until it's ready.

It was revealed that Jiren hardly cares for anyone else, not even Toppo or Belmod.</span></li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">To <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Frieza</a></em>.

They're both also determined to best the Saiyan.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoSimilar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoSimilar">Not So Similar</a>: In the anime. As learn more about Jiren it becomes very clear the difference between him and Goku in how they perceive strength and fighting. Goku loves fighting for its own sake and never holds his power above everyone or thinks he&#146;s superior to them and believes that fighting those that are hopelessly superior to one's self is the best way to live one's life and improve. Jiren believes strength is everything and fights purely to prove his superiority over everyone, and to prove the futility of fighting those stronger than yourself. Although Goku focuses on fighting and ignored Gohan&#146;s strategy, he still has a plethora of moments of teamwork with his fellow teammates and helps his team throughout the tournament and fights only for them by the end. Jiren doesn&#146;t seem to care, respect or even acknowledge anyone apart from Toppo and Dyspo. Or hardly anyone else at all. There&#146;s also the fact that out of both of them, when the chips are down, Goku shows himself as a bona fide hero, while Jiren transforms into a violent lunatic.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoInvincibleAfterAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoInvincibleAfterAll">Not So Invincible After All</a>: While Jiren is an absolute monster when it comes to power and has more than enough skill to use it effectively, it has been shown that he isn't unbeatable, just really, really, really, REALLY hard to beat. This is more the case in the anime, as in the manga he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">No Sells</a> literally <em>everything</em> prior to Mastered Ultra Instinct. Even SSBE Vegeta kicking him in the neck while he's off guard barely causes his head to budge.<ul><li> Goku entering Ultra-Instinct was enough to push Jiren back and brush his cheek with a punch. This was also the first time Jiren couldn't just one-shot an opponent.</li><li> Hit successfully pushed Jiren to the edge of the ring and managed to keep him there with a Time Cage that actually took an effort to break out of. Subverted in the manga where Jiren reveals he was just pretending to be at a disadvantage so he could eliminate Hit more easily.</li><li> Later on, Vegeta managed to see through Jiren's moves and actually managed to land a blow on Jiren's mid-section. Similarly, Android 17 manages to land a powerful Ki blast to his back when he wasn't paying attention, and Frieza was able to land a solid kick on him when his back was turned.</li><li> His biggest moment is when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Goku reawakens Ultra Instinct. He's shocked when Goku dodges the punch that should have ringed him out, gets visibly frustrated when Goku keeps dodging his attacks and ultimately <em>doubles over in pain</em> when Goku lands a gut punch.</span></li><li> And that moment is topped when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Goku masters Ultra Instinct. Jiren can't lay a finger on Goku and Goku sends him flying with a series of blows so fast we can't see it all while HAVING HIS BACK TURNED. Though he does briefly turn it around when he releases <em>all</em> his power at long last, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompCushion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompCushion">even managing to overpower Goku at several points and stalemate him</a>, his mistake of causing Goku to enter an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">Unstoppable Rage</a> ends with Goku actually defeating Jiren, and Universe 7 would have won then and there if Goku's body didn't betray him at that moment.

In the anime this is coincided with an Ultra Instinct-esque shirt rip &amp; glowing aura (albeit, a red one instead of blue).

That's why he didn't help his comrades when they were having problems during the Tournament, and called Toppo "pathetic" for leaving his ideals for power and not even winning the fight. At the same time, however, this appears to be deconstructed, as, during the fight with Goku, he stated he wants to find "something beyond strength", implying he feels empty about this point of view.

Sure, Jiren beat Hit with little contest, but Jiren had already beaten Goku (new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Mode</a> included) last episode, so no one expected Hit to win in-universe and out. The fact Hit managed to knock Jiren to the edge of the ring -with a crushed chest- and hold him there for a significant amount of time with a paralyzing technique marks the first time everyone in Universe 11 begins to seriously fear Jiren might actually lose. Even with Goku, Jiren was never actually pushed close to defeat.</li><li> This is later played further when Vegeta manages <em>to land a strong hit on Jiren</em> (by launching his entire body for one powerful kick/knee depending on the version), which noticeably took Jiren by surprise and caused him to fall back onto the defensive. While he defeated Vegeta once he calmed down, this one is quite noticeable for making Vegeta the only person prior to MUI Goku who actually did anything to base Jiren, even if it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage">Scratch Damage</a>.<div class="indent"> <strong>Vegeta:</strong> You were faster and stronger when fighting Kakarot!</div></li><li> He enacts this on Hit (who he defeats in one blow) and SSBE Vegeta. The latter is particularly notable in the manga. Vegeta defeats Toppo, who was a good match for CSSB Goku, by <em>flaring his aura</em> and nothing else, showing Vegeta is at a whole new level. He attacks Jiren aggressively, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfBarrage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfBarrage">The Worf Barrage</a> of blows he musters only dealing one tiny cut. Jiren responds with a mere <em>three</em> hits which are so damaging that they force Vegeta back into base. To make matters worse, this wasn't even his full power; he goes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">One-Winged Angel</a> at the end of chapter 40 and powers up <em>further</em> in the middle of chapter 41, showing that even his base, massively held back level is miles beyond everyone else.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorfHadTheFlu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorfHadTheFlu">Worf Had the Flu</a>: By the end of the Universe Survival arc in the anime, Jiren was spent after fighting MUI Goku (though unlike Goku, who had almost <em>completely</em> spent himself to the point of barely being able to move, Jiren is still able to crush powerful foes like 17 even in this state). He gets challenged by Frieza, whom he had <em>already beaten</em> a few episodes prior; he's still handily superior to the tyrant, but Frieza's toughness allows him to tank an exhausted Jiren's long enough to draw him into a trap by Android 17, which nearly costs him a chance at victory. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Despite getting a second wind, Jiren is unable to overcome Goku, Frieza, and Android 17 working in tandem and gets tackled out of bounds by the two archenemies in their <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToBadass">base forms</a></em>.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsStrongestMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsStrongestMan">World's Strongest Man</a>: Jiren might just be the strongest mortal <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeyondTheImpossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeyondTheImpossible">in the multiverse</a></em>, by far. Toppo even says even if he fails, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">Jiren would win</a>. Even more so, he's stronger than Belmod who's (at least physically) stronger than Beerus. By extension, he's probably stronger the rest of the GoDs too. He's certainly by far the strongest mortal in the tournament, which has 8 of the 12 universes competing in it. And all of that <em>before</em> he exceeds his own limits within the tournament. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Even when Goku gains his Mastered Ultra Instinct power-up, Jiren responds by activating his own eleventh hour power-up and <em>beating the shit out of him</em>. In the anime, is only by Goku overclocking his MUI after being enraged that anyone is <em>finally</em> able to actually overpower Jiren... for a couple minutes before said overclocking causes Goku to damage his own body and exhaust his energy, dropping him right down to base form, leaving Jiren to dominate him again. In the manga he doesn't even get that far, instead being knocked out of MUI the first time Jiren lands a solid blow. In the end, even after the damage Jiren had sustained both from Goku's attacks and overclocking himself to fight his MUI, it takes several different eleventh hour power-ups plus the efforts of all the remaining U7 fighters to finally beat Jiren... and even then, only by the technicality of knocking him out of the ring. Goku says that he still would've slaughtered them all without that specific rule.</span><ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It's implied that even in the anime, similar to Kefla vs UI Goku, Jiren was actually stronger than MUI Goku the whole time, but towards the end he just wasn't able to keep up with MUI's "auto-dodge" and "auto-attack" features. Whenever MUI Goku and Jiren get into a <em>direct</em> power-struggle, for instance their two beam clashes, Jiren always overpowers Goku; their brief grapple also seemed even, despite Jiren being the more tired of the two at that point. This is more apparent in the manga where Jiren is so overwhelmingly powerful compared to MUI Goku that even just blocking Jiren's blows takes a lot out of him. MUI Goku even hits him off-guard with a fully charged Kamehameha, the same technique that would have killed Cell who was much stronger than Goku at the time, and Jiren just gets right back up.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a>:<ul><li> Although he never openly acknowledges Goku or Hit as such (the closest to this is him saying Saiyans are "interesting"), he does admit that they are the only guys in the tournament he believes he would be required for and, after beating them, goes right back to meditating. After ringing out Hit, he doesn't even deem Goku worth fighting anymore, which absolutely infuriates Goku. Interestingly however this seems to change as after Goku attains UI once more he stops meditating. More importantly, when he and Goku fight again he seems legitimately interested in Goku&#146;s reasons for fighting, and when Goku almost rings him out he is seriously surprised and finally starts using his real power in response.<ul><li> In the manga, he considers Goku to be one due to him observing a major flaw in Hit's strategy. In fact, the two fight evenly (although Jiren isn't playing seriously at this point).</li></ul></li><li> He later recognizes Vegeta as one of these, actually calling him a warrior, which Belmod and Khai note is a pretty high compliment coming from Jiren. He does it again when Vegeta takes out Toppo.</li><li> He finally genuinely congratulates the remaining Universe 7 fighters for defeating Toppo when he's the last opponent standing. In particular, he praises Goku and Vegeta for achieving the strength they have without compromising who they are as fighters and people.</li><li> As Goku ascends to the true power of Ultra Instinct, Jiren smiles, happy to have an opponent who can demand so much from him and is clearly enjoying the thought of battling him. He gives the most respectful speech to Goku yet when he's about to blast him off the ring, calling him "proud warrior, Son Goku", telling him he wishes the fight could end another way, and that Goku will always live on in his memories.</li></ul></li></ul></div><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_content_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_content_1'); })</script></div></div><hr><p></p><div class="indent"><em>"<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase">It's over.</a>"</em><div class="indent">&mdash; <strong>Jiren</strong></div></div>
